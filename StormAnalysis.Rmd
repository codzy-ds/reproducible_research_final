## Introduction
This document will analyse the storm event database from the National weather services. This analysis will try to answer two question : 

1- Which types of events, inside the united states are the most harmful with respect to population health.
2- Inside the United States, which types of events have the geatest economic consequences.

## Data Processing
```{r echo=TRUE}
if(!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
  download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", "data/dataset.csv.bz2")
}
data <- read.csv2("data/dataset.csv.bz2", sep = ",")
```

## Results

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
